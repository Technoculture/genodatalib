workflow:
  - name: attempt_pickup_tip
    why: We need a tip in order to pick up the sample and move it to DNA extraction stage
      #  - name: move_sample_from_storage_to_extractor
      #    why: We need to pick a sample from the storage in order to process it
      #  - name: extract_dna
      #    why: We need DNA from the saliva for this experiment
      #  - name: amplify_dna
      #    why: We need to amplify the DNA in our sample, in this workflow this step is also where the detection is completed
      #  - name: analyse_and_report_result
      #    why: We need to turn the data generated from the detector to the cloud for further processing and generation of notifications and PDF reports to the end user
      #  - name: Discard Sample
      #    why: We do not need this sample anymore, discarding is a good option
